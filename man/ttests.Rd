Many t-tests
}

\description{
It performs very many t-tests.
}

\usage{
ttests(x, ina, paired = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with the data, where the rows denote the samples (and the two groups) and the columns are the variables.
}
\item{ina}{
A numerical vector with 1s and 2s indicating the two groups. Be careful, the funct?on is designed to accept only these two numbers.
}
\item{paired}{
If the groups are not independent paired t-tests should be performed and this must be TRUE, otherwise, leave it FALSE. In this case, the two groups must have equal smaple sizes, otherwise no test will be performed.
}
}

\details{
If the groups are independent, the Welch's t-test (without assuming equal variances) is performed. Otherwise many paired t-tests are performed.
}

\value{
A matrix with the test statistic, the degrees of freedom (if the groups are independent) and the p-value of each test.

\examples{
## 10000 variables, hence 10000 t-tests will be performed
x = matrix( rnorm(200 * 1000), ncol = 1000 )
## 200 observations in total
ina = rbinom(200, 1, 0.6) + 1   ## independent samples t-test
system.time( ttests(x, ina) )

ina = rep(1:2, each = 100)   ## dependent samples t-test
system.time( ttests(x, ina, paired = TRUE) )
