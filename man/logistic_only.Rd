\title{
Many univariate simple binary logistic regressions
}

\description{
It performs very many univariate simple binary logistic regressions.
}

\usage{
logistic_only(x, y, tol = 1e-09, b_values = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with the data, where the rows denote the samples (and the two groups) and the columns are the variables. Currently only continuous variables are allowed.
}
\item{y}{
The dependent variable; a numerical vector with two values (0  and 1). 
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance value to terminate the Newton-Raphson algorithm.
}
\item{b_values}{
Do you want the values of the coefficients returned? If yes, set this to TRUE.
}
}

\details{
The function is written in C++ and this is why it is very fast. It can accept thousands of predictor variables. It is usefull for univariate screening. 
We provide no p-value correction (such as fdr or q-values); this is up to the user. 
}

\value{
A vector with the deviance of each simple binayr logistic regression model for each predictor variable.

\examples{
## 300 variables, hence 300 univariate regressions are to be fitted
x = matrix( rnorm(100 * 300), ncol = 300 )

## 100 observations in total
y = rbinom(100, 1, 0.6)   ## binary logistic regression
system.time( logistic_only(x, y) )
a1 = logistic_only(x, y)
 
a2 <- numeric(300)
system.time( for (i in 1:300) a2[i] = glm(y ~ x[, i], binomial)$deviance )
a2 = as.vector(a2)
all.equal(a1, a2)

a1<-a2<-y<-x<-NULL
